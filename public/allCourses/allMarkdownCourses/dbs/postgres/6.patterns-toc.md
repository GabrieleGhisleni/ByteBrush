## Database Structure Design patterns
SQL Schema desgienr is a very important role in the development of a database. The schema designer is responsible for designing the database schema, which is the structure of the database. The schema designer is also responsible for designing the tables, columns, and relationships between them.

Some of them are:

Database Structure Design Patterns "LIKE" System:

### Polymorphic Association

In a polymorphic association, a 'like' can belong to different types of entities such as a post, comment, or photo. This is achieved by using two fields in the 'likes' table - one for the entity type (e.g., post, comment, photo) and one for the entity ID.

| LikeID | EntityType | EntityID | UserID |
|--------|------------|----------|--------|
| 1      | Post       | 10       | 100    |
| 2      | Comment    | 20       | 200    |
| 3      | Photo      | 30       | 300    |

In this pattern, EntityType and EntityID together represent a polymorphic association.

Pros:
- Reduces the number of tables in the database, as all 'likes' are stored in a single table regardless of the entity type.
- Simplifies queries for total likes, as there's only one table to query.

  Cons:
- The EntityType column usually uses strings which can lead to more storage usage and slower lookups.
- It can be more complex to handle different entity types in the application code.
  
###  Multiple Column

In a multiple column 'like' system, each type of entity that can be liked (e.g., post, comment, photo) has its own column in the 'likes' table.

| LikeID | PostID | CommentID | PhotoID | UserID |
|--------|--------|-----------|---------|--------|
| 1      | 10     | NULL      | NULL    | 100    |
| 2      | NULL   | 20        | NULL    | 200    |
| 3      | NULL   | NULL      | 30      | 300    |

In this pattern, only one of PostID, CommentID, or PhotoID would be non-null in each row, indicating the entity that was liked.

Pros:
- It's easy to see which entity type a 'like' belongs to, as each entity type has its own column.
- It can be faster to lookup likes for a specific entity type, as you can query directly on the relevant column.

  Cons:
- This design can lead to a lot of NULL values in the table, which can be a waste of storage.
- If a new entity type that can be liked is added, the 'likes' table schema needs to be altered to add a new column.

### Multiple Tables

In a multiple tables 'like' system, there is a separate 'likes' table for each type of entity that can be liked.

PostLikes:

| LikeID | PostID | UserID |
|--------|--------|--------|
| 1      | 10     | 100    |

CommentLikes:

| LikeID | CommentID | UserID |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| 2      | 20        | 200    |

PhotoLikes:

| LikeID | PhotoID | UserID |
|--------|---------|--------|
| 3      | 30      | 300    |

In this pattern, each table represents likes for a specific type of entity.

Pros:
- It's very clear which entity type a 'like' belongs to, as each entity type has its own table.
- It can be faster to lookup likes for a specific entity type, as you can query directly on the relevant table.
- Adding a new entity type that can be liked just requires adding a new table, without altering existing tables.

  Cons:
- Increases the number of tables in the database, which can make the database schema more complex.
- Queries for total likes across all entity types can be more complex, as they need to combine data from multiple tables.
