## Other compute services: ECS, ECR, Fargate, Lambda, Batch, Lightsail
### ECS (Elastic Container Service)
It allow to launch docker containers on AWS, you must provision the EC2 instances yourself.
ECS (Elastic Container Service) is a highly scalable, high-performance container orchestration service that supports Docker containers and allows you to easily run and scale containerized applications on AWS.

### FarGate
AWS Fargate is a serverless compute engine for containers that works with both Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) and Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS). Fargate makes it easy for you to focus on building your applications without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.

Function: Fargate allows you to run containers without managing servers or clusters. It eliminates the need to choose server types, decide when to scale your clusters, or optimize cluster packing. Fargate automatically scales and manages the infrastructure required to run your containers.

Real-world use case: A company that wants to deploy a microservices architecture could use Fargate. They could package each microservice in a container, and then use Fargate to deploy and manage those containers. This would allow the company to focus on developing their microservices, rather than managing the infrastructure required to run them.

### ECR (Elastic Container Registry)
ECR (Elastic Container Registry) is a fully-managed Docker container registry service provided by AWS. It allows developers to store, manage, and deploy Docker container images. ECR is secure and scalable, allowing you to deploy containers for your applications.

Function: ECR eliminates the need to operate your own container repositories or worry about scaling the underlying infrastructure. It hosts your images in a highly available and scalable architecture, allowing you to reliably deploy images for your applications.

Integration: ECR integrates with Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) and Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), simplifying your development to production workflow. You can easily push your container images to ECR using the Docker CLI from your development machine, and ECS or EKS can pull them directly for production deployments.

Real-world use case: A software company developing a microservices-based application can use ECR to store and manage Docker images for each microservice. The developers can push the Docker images to ECR, and the operations team can deploy the application to a Kubernetes cluster in EKS using the images stored in ECR. This allows for a streamlined, efficient, and reliable process from development to deployment.

### Lambda
Is the pioneer of serverless compute. It is a compute service where you can upload your code and create a Lambda
function. AWS Lambda takes care of provisioning and managing the servers that you use to run the code. You don't have
to worry about operating systems, patching, scaling, etc.

With Lambda differently to Ec2 we have **virtual functions** (we don't have to manage the servers), they are limited
by time (**short executions**) and **run on-demand** (no charge when the code is not running) lastly the scaling
is automated.

#### Benefits of Lambda
Lambda have many benefits:

1. Easy pricing (pay per request and compute time)
2. Integrated with other AWS services
3. Event-driven (Lambda can be triggered by events, reactive type of services)
4. Easy monitoring through AWS CloudWatch
5. Easy to get more resources per function (just increase the memory)
6. Languages supported: Node.js, Python, Java, C#, Go, PowerShell, Ruby, and Custom Runtime API (any programming language)

if it comes to run Docker images on Lambda we need Lambda Container Image Support. It is a feature that allows us to
run Lambda functions as a container image.

![Lambda](images/lambda.png)

This example is complety full serverless, we have a Lambda function that is triggered by an API Gateway, the Lambda
function is connected to DynamoDB and S3, and the Lambda function is also connected to CloudWatch to monitor the
function.

#### Lambda CRON Job (CloudWatch Events)
Another use case is a serverless cron job (schedule), based on it run a script. We can use CloudWatch Events to trigger
Lambda functions at a specific time.

#### Pricing:
Lambda pricing is based on calls and duration and is very cheap.

- You pay per calls:
  - First 1 million requests are free
  - $0.20 per 1 million requests thereafter ($0.0000002 per request)
- Pay per duration:
  - Duration is calculated from the time your code begins executing until it returns or otherwise terminates, rounded up to the nearest 1 ms.
  - The price depends on the amount of memory you allocate to your function. You are charged $0.00001667 for every GB-second used.
  - The free tier provides 400,000 GB-seconds of compute time per month.

#### Create Lambda function
There are different type of Lambda function, we can select blueprint then we create the new role, and then we can
create the function.

In configuration we can set many important things like the timeout, memory, and the VPC.

#### Lambda Triggers
Lambda can be triggered by many AWS services, for example:
- API Gateway
- CloudFront
- S3 (Object Created, Object Removed, Object Restore)

in order to handle these events we need to create a Lambda function and then we can select the trigger, for example
if we select S3 we can select the bucket and the event type.

An example of lambda function taking a photo as input from an s3 bucket:

```python
from PIL import Image
import boto3
import uuid
import os

s3 = boto3.client('s3')

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    for record in event['Records']:
        bucket = record['s3']['bucket']['name']
        key = record['s3']['object']['key']
        download_path = '/tmp/{}{}'.format(uuid.uuid4(), key)
        upload_path = '/tmp/resized-{}'.format(key)

        s3.download_file(bucket, key, download_path)
        resize_image(download_path, upload_path)
        s3.upload_file(upload_path, '{}resized'.format(bucket), key)

def resize_image(image_path, resized_path):
    with Image.open(image_path) as image:
        image.thumbnail(tuple(x / 2 for x in image.size))
        image.save(resized_path)
```

### Amaazon API Gateway
Amazon API Gateway is a fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale. APIs act as the "front door" for applications to access data, business logic, or functionality from your backend services.

Function: The primary function of Amazon API Gateway is to handle RESTful API calls from client applications and route them to the appropriate backend services. It can handle thousands of concurrent API calls, including traffic management, authorization and access control, monitoring, and API version management.

Integration: API Gateway integrates with several other AWS services. For instance, it can route incoming API calls to AWS Lambda functions, Amazon EC2 instances, or an Elastic Load Balancer. It also integrates with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) for access control, AWS CloudWatch for monitoring, and AWS Cognito for user authentication.

Real-world use case: A mobile app developer can use API Gateway to manage and run APIs for their mobile application. The APIs can be configured to trigger AWS Lambda functions that run the app's backend code, retrieve data from a DynamoDB table, or stream data to Amazon Kinesis. This allows the developer to focus on writing code for their app, without worrying about managing the underlying infrastructure.

### AWS Batch
AWS Batch is a cloud-based service provided by Amazon Web Services that is designed to handle batch computing workloads. Batch computing is a form of computing where a large amount of data is processed in a single batch, rather than processing it in real-time. 

Function: AWS Batch effectively manages the execution of batch jobs. It dynamically provisions the optimal quantity and type of compute resources (e.g., CPU or memory-optimized instances) based on the volume and specific resource requirements of the batch jobs submitted. This eliminates the need to install and manage batch computing software, allowing you to focus on analyzing results and solving problems.

Integration: AWS Batch is integrated with other AWS services such as Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) and Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service). It uses EC2 instances to process jobs, and can store and retrieve data from S3. It also integrates with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) for secure access control, and CloudWatch for monitoring.

Real-world use case: A real-world use case for AWS Batch could be a pharmaceutical company that needs to analyze a large dataset of drug compounds. Instead of investing in expensive high-performance computing hardware and software, the company could use AWS Batch to process the data in the cloud. The company would only pay for the compute resources they use, and could scale up or down based on demand.

### AWS Lightsail
AWS Lightsail is a cloud computing service provided by Amazon Web Services that simplifies the process of launching and managing applications and websites. It's designed to be user-friendly and cost-effective, making it a great choice for small businesses or individuals who are new to the cloud.

Function: AWS Lightsail provides virtual private servers (instances), storage, databases, and networking capabilities. It also offers a static IP address, DNS management, and a user-friendly management interface. It's designed to be easy to use, with pre-configured application stacks and development stacks like LAMP, Node.js, WordPress, Joomla, and more.

Integration: AWS Lightsail integrates with other AWS services like Amazon RDS for database services, Amazon S3 for storage, and AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) for access control. It also integrates with Amazon CloudWatch for monitoring and AWS CloudTrail for logging activities.

Real-world use case: A small business owner wants to launch a website but doesn't have extensive knowledge of cloud computing. They can use AWS Lightsail to easily set up a WordPress website, with all the necessary components (like a virtual server and database) pre-configured. They can then manage their website through the Lightsail console, without needing to understand the complexities of the underlying AWS infrastructure.
