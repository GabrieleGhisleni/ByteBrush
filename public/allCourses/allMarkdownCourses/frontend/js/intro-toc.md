## Introduction

JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is primarily used for enhancing interactivity and
improving the user experience on web pages. It is one of the three core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside
HTML and CSS. JavaScript enables interactive web features such as form submissions, animations, user activity tracking,
and more.

JavaScript is a versatile language and can be used for both client-side and server-side development. This is made
possible by environments such as Node.js, which allows JavaScript to run outside of the browser.

Now, let's delve into the core components of JavaScript:

1. **Variables**: Variables are used to store data values. In JavaScript, you declare a variable using the `var`, `let`,
   or `const` keyword.

2. **Data Types**: JavaScript has several data types including Number, String, Boolean, Object, Null, and Undefined.

3. **Operators**: JavaScript uses arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators to perform operations on values.

4. **Control Structures**: These include conditional statements like `if`, `else`, `switch`, and loops like `for`
   , `while`, and `do while`.

5. **Functions**: Functions are blocks of code designed to perform a particular task. They are executed when they are
   called or invoked.

6. **Objects**: JavaScript is an object-oriented language and uses objects to model real-world things. Objects are
   variables too, but they contain many values, referred to as properties and methods.

7. **Events**: JavaScript allows you to create interactive web pages with Event Handlers. An event can be something the
   browser does, or something a user does.

8. **Error Handling**: JavaScript provides several methods for catching and handling errors, including `try`, `catch`
   , `throw`, and `finally` statements.

9. **DOM Manipulation**: The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the
   structure of a document and allows JavaScript to manipulate the content and structure of a web page.

10. **Asynchronous JavaScript**: JavaScript is single-threaded, but it can achieve concurrency through the use of
    callbacks, promises, and async/await.

These are the core components of JavaScript. Each component plays a crucial role in the functionality of the language
and contributes to the development of interactive and dynamic web pages.
