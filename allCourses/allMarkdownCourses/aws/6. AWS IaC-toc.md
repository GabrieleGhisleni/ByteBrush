## Deploy and managing infrastructure at scale: CloudFormation, Elastic Beanstalk, OpsWorks, and CloudDeploy
### CloudFormation (IaC)
It is a declarative way of outlining your AWS Infrastructure, for any resources (most of them are supported). For
example within a CloudFormation template we can say: I want a security group, I want two EC2 instances using this
security group, I want an S3 bucket, and I want a load balancer in front of these EC2 instances.

then CloudFormation creates those for us, it will provision all the resources in the right order with the exact
configuration that we specify.

It is **infrastructure as code**. It is a very powerful tool to automate the deployment of your infrastructure.
The main benefits are:
- Automated provisioning
- Infrastructure as code
- Cost estimation
- Productivity

#### CloudFormation Template
It is a JSON/YAML file that describes your AWS infrastructure. It is declarative, we specify what we want and AWS
CloudFormation will take care of the rest.
example:
```yaml
AWSTemplateFormatVersion: "2010-09-09"
Description: "Simple CloudFormation template"
Resources:
  MyEC2Instance:
    Type: "AWS::EC2::Instance"
    Properties:
      AvailabilityZone: "us-east-1a"
      ImageId: "ami-0ff8a91507f77f867"
      InstanceType: "t2.micro"

  SecurityGroup:
    Type: "AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup"
    Properties:
      GroupDescription: "Allow SSH and HTTP access"
      SecurityGroupIngress:
        - IpProtocol: "tcp"
          FromPort: "22"
          ToPort: "22"
          CidrIp: "
```

#### AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK)
it define your cloud infrastructure using an imperative programming language. It is a software development framework
for defining cloud infrastructure in code and provisioning it through AWS CloudFormation. Instead of writing YAML or
JSON CloudFormation templates, we can define our infrastructure using TypeScript, Python, Java, C# or JavaScript and then
compile it into CloudFormation template.

#### Aws Beanstalk (PaaS)
AWS Elastic Beanstalk is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) offered by Amazon Web Services. This service is designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier for developers. It provides an environment to easily deploy and run applications in the language of your choice.

When we deploy a web application tipically we use a ELB + ASG + EC2 + RDS. Elastic Beanstalk is a service that allows
us to deploy and scale web applications and services.

It is a developer centric view of deploying an application on AWS. It uses all the components we need to deploy and
scale our application (ELB, ASG, EC2, RDS, etc). We simply upload our application code and Elastic Beanstalk will
automatically handle the deployment, from capacity provisioning, load balancing, auto-scaling to application health
monitoring.

It is free but we pay for the underlying instances.

there are three architecture models:
- Single instance deployment: good for dev
- LB + ASG: great for production or pre-production web applications
- ASG only: great for non-web apps in production (workers, etc)

it supports many platforms (includes docker python and so on.) and it also has a full monitored dashboard and
even a CLI and IDE integration for metrics and logs.

under the hood it uses CloudFormation.

### AWS CodeDeploy

CodeDeploy is a deployment service that automates application deployments to various compute services such as Amazon EC2, AWS Fargate, AWS Lambda, and your on-premises servers. It helps you to release new features rapidly, avoid downtime during application deployment, and handle the complexity of updating your applications. 

Integration: CodeDeploy can be integrated with AWS CodePipeline to create a continuous delivery pipeline. 

Use Case: If you have a web application hosted on EC2 instances and you want to automate the deployment process whenever a new version of the application is released, you can use CodeDeploy.

It is a service that automates code deployments to any instance, it works with ec2 instances and on-premises servers (hybrid service)

### AWS CodeCommit

CodeCommit is a fully-managed source control service that hosts secure Git-based repositories. It makes it easy for teams to collaborate on code in a secure and highly scalable ecosystem. 

Integration: CodeCommit can be integrated with AWS CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, and CodePipeline for a fully managed, end-to-end, continuous integration and delivery system.

Use Case: If you are developing a software application and you need a centralized repository to store, manage, and track code, AWS CodeCommit is the service to use.

It is a managed source control service that hosts secure Git-based repositories. It is a private Git repository. It is a
fully managed service that scales automatically. It is integrated with CodePipeline and CodeDeploy.

### AWS CodeBuild
CodeBuild is a fully managed build service that compiles source code, runs tests, and produces software packages that are ready to deploy. It eliminates the need to set up, patch, and manage your own build servers.

Integration: CodeBuild can be integrated with CodeCommit, CodeDeploy, and CodePipeline. For example, you can use CodePipeline to orchestrate the entire software release process, where CodeBuild is used as one of the stages in the pipeline.

Use Case: If you have a Java application stored in a CodeCommit repository and you want to compile the code and run unit tests every time a change is made, you can use CodeBuild.

It allow to build and test code with continuous scaling. It is a fully managed build service that compiles source code,
runs tests and produces software packages that are ready to deploy. It is integrated with CodePipeline.

### AWS CodePipeline

CodePipeline is a fully managed continuous delivery service that helps you automate your release pipelines for fast and reliable application and infrastructure updates. 

Integration: CodePipeline integrates with AWS services such as CodeCommit, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, and CodeStar, as well as third-party tools like GitHub, Jenkins, and TeamCity.

Use Case: If you want to automate the release process of your application, where the code is stored in CodeCommit, built using CodeBuild, and deployed using CodeDeploy, you can use CodePipeline to orchestrate the entire process.

It is a continuous delivery service that automates your release pipelines for fast and reliable application and
infrastructure updates. It is a CI/CD tool. It is a fully managed service that helps us automate our release pipelines
for fast and reliable application and infrastructure updates. It is a continuous delivery service that automates your
